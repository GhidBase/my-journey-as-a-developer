    <h1>My experience so far with learning programming</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Learning C# and Unity</h2>
    <p><strong>I have been learning to make software for awhile now.</strong> I believe my trading card app built in Unity is about 9 months old at this point, if I include past attempts on Unity. I took a course partway through that, which taught me C# and a bit of dotnet. After that, I knew enough that I no longer had to "attempt" to make apps. I had all the skills needed to make the app I wanted to make. I integrated firebase into my application before learning the fundamentals of C# Now that I'm certified, I don't have to stop partway through making an app realizing I don't know how to continue. I always know how to continue, or I know how to find the information needed to continue.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Learning Web Dev</h2>
    <p>
        <em>I have now switched gears to Web Dev for the time being.</em> Using The Odin Project has been very eye opening already and I'm glad I didn't just follow youtube tutorials. I have been using Linux in a virtual machine the last couple of days and it's been a blast. I can see how using the command line is an easier way to navigate the filesystem already. Even though it <strong><em>seems</em></strong> kind of like a gimmick, I can tell that it's actually a worthwhile skill. Not only that, but having learned how to do that before I learned git, I think was a good move. I think I have a much deeper understanding of what the git commands I'm typing out actually do now that I understand more of the command line.

        I should add that I'm not completely new to the command line, having used batch growing up, and also having made console applications exclusively during my C# certification course. I am glad I had that experience, particularly the C# experience since it was more in-depth. Now that I've tried my hand at these different things, I can tell my skill set is growing at a rapid pace again. Anyways. I think that's enough for this initial posting about my software journey.
